        <div class="chapter-content">
            <p>Three weeks before their wedding, Clara and Alex found themselves in complete agreement about the future. They sat in their shared apartment in Adelaide, with open wedding planning folders and excited dreams spread out before them like a roadmap to happiness.</p>

            <p>They had faced so many challenges, overcome obstacles, and now they saw a clear path ahead. Neither of them had ever felt so secure and certain that they had found their life partner.</p>

            <p>Clara looked at the wedding invitations on the table and smiled. "I can hardly believe we're really getting married in three weeks," she said softly, reaching for Alex's hand. "After everything we've been through."</p>

            <p>Alex squeezed her hand and pulled her closer. "I've never been more certain of anything in my life," he replied, his voice warm and confident. "You and I, together ‚Äì that's all I need for a perfect future."</p>

            <p>Outside their window, Adelaide sparkled in the evening light. The city that had brought them together, where they had fallen in love, where they had built their careers and their dreams. Everything seemed to be falling into place perfectly.</p>

            <p>"I've been thinking about our conversation yesterday," Clara began carefully, "about children and our future family plans." She paused and looked at Alex expectantly. "Are you still sure that you want children with me?"</p>

            <p>Alex didn't hesitate for a second. "More than anything else in the world," he replied firmly. "I want everything with you, Clara. A family, a house with a garden, maybe even a dog." He laughed. "The whole domestic happiness package."</p>

            <p>Clara smiled relieved. "I was a bit worried that you might have second thoughts about the responsibility."</p>

            <p>"Never," Alex said decisively. "With you by my side, I'm ready for any adventure life brings us."</p>

            <p>They spent the evening making concrete plans for their honeymoon. They had decided on a trip to the Blue Mountains, where they wanted to spend two weeks in a romantic cabin surrounded by nature.</p>

            <p>"I can already see us walking through the forests," Clara said dreamily, "waking up to birdsong every morning, having breakfast on the veranda while watching the sunset."</p>

            <p>"And in the evenings we'll sit by the fireplace and make plans for our first house," Alex added. "We could start looking for something as soon as we get back."</p>

            <p>The next few days passed in a whirlwind of wedding preparations. Final fittings, last-minute confirmations with vendors, excited phone calls with family and friends who would be arriving soon for the celebration.</p>

            <p>Clara felt like she was floating on a cloud of happiness. Everything in her life seemed to be perfect. Her career was flourishing, her relationship with Alex was stronger than ever, and now they were about to take the next big step together.</p>

            <p>One evening, while they were addressing the last wedding invitations, Alex suddenly looked up. "Clara, I have something to tell you," he said, his voice slightly nervous.</p>

            <p>Clara looked up, slightly worried. "What is it?"</p>

            <p>"It's nothing bad," Alex reassured her quickly. "Quite the opposite, actually. I got a job offer today. A really good one."</p>

            <p>Clara's eyes lit up. "That's wonderful! Tell me everything!"</p>

            <p>"It's a position as senior architect at one of Adelaide's most prestigious firms," Alex explained excitedly. "The salary is significantly higher than what I'm earning now, and the projects are exactly what I've always dreamed of working on."</p>

            <p>"Alex, that's incredible!" Clara jumped up and hugged him tightly. "I'm so proud of you!"</p>

            <p>"The best part is," Alex continued, "with this salary we could afford a really nice house. Maybe even something with a view of the hills."</p>

            <p>Clara felt tears of happiness in her eyes. "Everything is just perfect," she whispered. "I can't believe how lucky we are."</p>

            <p>The following week brought a few small challenges. Clara's wedding dress needed a last-minute alteration, and there was a misunderstanding with the catering company that required some quick problem-solving. But nothing could dampen their spirits.</p>

            <p>"You know what I love most about us?" Clara said one evening as they sat on their balcony, watching the stars. "We make such a good team. No matter what problems come our way, we always find a solution together."</p>

            <p>Alex nodded in agreement. "That's exactly what I was thinking. We complement each other perfectly. Where I'm impulsive, you're thoughtful. Where you sometimes doubt yourself, I bring confidence."</p>

            <p>"And where you sometimes get lost in your dreams, I bring you back to reality," Clara added with a smile.</p>

            <p>"That's the perfect foundation for a marriage," Alex said, taking her hand. "I can't wait to call you my wife."</p>

            <p>Two weeks before the wedding, they received a surprise visit from Clara's sister Emma, who had flown in from Sydney earlier than planned.</p>

            <p>"I couldn't wait to see you!" Emma hugged Clara tightly. "I've missed you so much, and I'm so excited about the wedding!"</p>

            <p>Emma's presence brought even more joy to the final preparations. The three of them spent wonderful days together, shopping for last-minute details, laughing about old memories, and making new ones.</p>

            <p>"I've never seen you so happy," Emma told Clara one afternoon while Alex was at work. "Alex is really perfect for you. You can see how much he loves you just by the way he looks at you."</p>

            <p>Clara blushed slightly. "I know. Sometimes I have to pinch myself to make sure I'm not dreaming."</p>

            <p>"That's how it should be," Emma said warmly. "True love should feel like the most beautiful dream that's actually real."</p>

            <p>The day before the wedding, everything was finally ready. The venue was decorated, the flowers were arranged, the cake was perfect, and all the guests had arrived safely.</p>

            <p>Clara and Alex spent their last evening as an unmarried couple with their closest friends and family at a relaxed dinner. There were touching speeches, lots of laughter, and a palpable sense of anticipation for the big day ahead.</p>

            <p>"Tomorrow at this time, we'll be married," Alex whispered to Clara as they said goodnight.</p>

            <p>"I can hardly wait," Clara replied, giving him a long, loving kiss. "See you at the altar, my soon-to-be husband."</p>

            <p>As Clara lay in bed that night, she felt a deep sense of gratitude and happiness. Her life was about to change forever, and she couldn't imagine anything more perfect than the future that lay ahead of her and Alex.</p>

            <p>The wedding day dawned bright and clear, with a gentle breeze and perfect temperature. It was as if the universe itself was celebrating with them.</p>
