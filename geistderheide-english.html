                <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 1: The Beginning</h2>

                <p>The rain pattered in irregular drops on the cobblestone street, forming small, glittering puddles in the hollows of the old stone. Dusk had already fallen, and the pale light of the gas lamps bathed the surroundings in a dim twilight that intensified shadows in the corners and distorted the shapes of the buildings. In the distance, the shrill whistle of a train pierced through the night as a young man, wrapped in a dark coat, slowly walked down the street.</p>

                <p>He was no older than twenty, yet his gaze seemed to radiate a maturity that belied his age. His eyes were of an unusual paleness, almost like milky glass that only came alive when light fell on it at the right angle. The tension was almost palpable as he repeatedly looked over his shoulder, as if he expected someone to be watching him.</p>

                <p>His name was Elias, and today was the day everything would change. For weeks he had been receiving the mysterious letters‚Äîhandwritten in an old-fashioned script that he himself could not decipher, but someone he knew had cast a disturbing glance at the words and had promised to translate them. She had seemed suspicious to him, this woman who had nested around the corner of an antique shop. But his curiosity was too great to ignore her.</p>

                <p>Elias entered a small caf√© on the edge of the district. The familiar smell of freshly brewed coffee and the quiet murmur of the guests gave him a moment of peace before the door closed behind him again. The young woman behind the counter raised her head and smiled. "Elias, you're late."</p>

                <p>"Sorry, Celia," he murmured and pushed a wet strand of hair from his forehead. He nodded to her and settled at a small table in the back corner, where he was undisturbed. The letters pressed heavily in his pocket, as if they were burdened with more than just words.</p>

                <p>Celia brought him a cup of coffee, looked around briefly, then sat down across from him. She lowered her voice as she asked: "Do you have the documents with you?"</p>

                <p>Elias nodded and pulled out the old sheets that looked fragile and weathered, as if they had lived a whole life before they had come into his hands. Celia looked at him penetratingly before she carefully picked up one of the letters and skimmed it. Her eyes widened slightly before she whispered quietly: "Where did you get these letters from?"</p>

                <p>"They were just... there," Elias replied and shrugged. "Each time one lay in front of my door. I have no idea who put them there."</p>

                <p>Celia slowly shook her head. "Elias, this is not a normal language. The words‚Äîthey are not from here. It is Old-Mythic." She put the letter on the table and looked directly into his eyes. "Do you know what that means?"</p>

                <p>Elias shook his head. "Not really. Only that it's somehow important."</p>

                <p>"It is. This language has not been spoken for centuries. It is a language of magic." Her voice sank to a whisper. "Only those who possess knowledge of the Ancients can understand it at all."</p>

                <p>A shiver ran down his spine. Until this moment he had never believed in magic, or in the ancient stories that had been told to him as a child. But something about the mysterious letters, about the delicate letters that seemed to be written with a quill pen, awakened a strange fascination in him.</p>

                <p>"What should I do now?" he asked, barely getting the words over his lips.</p>

                <p>"You must find the origin of these letters," Celia answered. "Perhaps the sender knows more about what you are."</p>

                <p>"What I am?" Elias blinked at her in confusion.</p>

                <p>"Yes," she said and looked around the caf√© as if she wanted to make sure no one was listening. "You have something about you that is not... ordinary. Have you never noticed that you are different from others? That you can see things that others cannot perceive?"</p>

                <p>Elias nodded, although he had repeatedly tried to suppress these observations. Small anomalies that only he had perceived, fleeting shadows in the corner of his field of vision, whispering in the silence‚Äîhe had always considered it his own imagination.</p>

                <p>"There is a place," Celia said quietly and pushed him a crumpled map. "It lies deep in the forest, hidden from the eyes of most people. Go there, and you will find the answers you seek. But be careful. This path is dangerous."</p>

                <p>The weight of her words hung in the air, and Elias could not help but return her gaze. He felt that he was at a turning point in his life‚Äîa point where he could either return or take the first step into the unknown.</p>

                <p>The decision was not difficult for him. Deep inside he knew he had no choice. Something in him called for this path, for the truth that might be painful, but inevitable.</p>

                <p>With a last sip from his coffee cup he rose, thanked Celia and stepped out into the night. The rain had become lighter by now, and the street shimmered in the soft light of the lanterns. Before him stretched the darkness‚Äîa darkness he hoped to fathom.</p>

                <p>Elias didn't know what awaited him, but he felt driven by a force he could not name‚Äîand so he disappeared into the night, searching for the Gate of the Ancients and the answers that would change his life forever.</p>
