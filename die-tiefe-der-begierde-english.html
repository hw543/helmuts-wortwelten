                <p>The pigment crumbled under Elena's careful movements. Tiny particles of color, once brilliant red, now faded to a dull brown, trickled onto the white cloth she had spread beneath the painting. Over two hundred years ago, an artist had mixed this hue with mercury sulfide and organic binders, never imagining that his creation would one day lie under Elena's microscope and scalpel.</p>

                <p>"Centuries," she murmured, as she skillfully exposed the next layer with practiced fingers. "And yet you still reveal your secrets to me."</p>

                <p>Elena Winters worked in the spacious restoration studio of the Friedrich Museum in Berlin, surrounded by specialized instruments, chemicals, and reference works. The tall windows let in even northern light -- the ideal light for her precise work. The late Baroque painting, a depiction of the goddess Diana hunting, had been her project for three weeks. It was a challenge, but that's exactly what made the work so satisfying for her.</p>

                <p>Elena's phone vibrated on the work table. She ignored it. The area around Diana's right eye required her full concentration -- too many overpainted layers, too much varnish, applied by well-meaning but unskilled restorers of past centuries. Her task was to penetrate through all these layers to reach the original without damaging it.</p>

                <p>The phone vibrated again. Elena sighed, set aside her scalpel, and stripped off her latex gloves. It was Director Schumann, as the display revealed. The museum director rarely called her directly; normally he communicated through his assistant or email.</p>

                <p>"Winters," she answered curtly.</p>

                <p>"Elena, good to reach you." The director's voice sounded unusually enthusiastic. "Could you be in my office in half an hour? I have someone here who would like to meet you."</p>

                <p>She looked at the half-restored painting. "I'm in the middle of working on the Diana, Director."</p>

                <p>"That can wait. This opportunity cannot."</p>

                <p>Elena suppressed a sigh. In her profession, she had learned that time was relative. For her, minutes sometimes meant the difference between preserved and destroyed history. For administrators like Schumann, appointments and networking conversations were more important.</p>

                <p>"Alright. Thirty minutes."</p>

                <p>She hung up and began methodically securing her workspace. The painting was carefully covered, the instruments cleaned, and the chemicals locked away. Elena removed her white lab coat and examined her reflection in the window pane. Her reddish-brown hair was bound in a strict knot, her clothing -- simple black pants and a gray silk blouse -- was practical and inconspicuous. The only extravagance she allowed herself was an antique brooch of silver filigree -- a heirloom from her grandmother and a subtle hint of her connection to the past.</p>

                <p>On her way to the director's office, Elena passed through the museum's public galleries. Tourists and art lovers strolled among the masterpieces, taking selfies in front of paintings or listening attentively to the explanations of museum guides. All these people saw only the polished surface -- the completed restoration process, the polished presentation. The painstaking work that she and her colleagues performed in secret remained invisible.</p>

                <p>That's exactly how Elena wanted it. She preferred to work in the background, immersing herself in the intimacy of artworks, learning their secrets. She gladly left the spotlight moments to others.</p>

                <p>Schumann's office was located in the historic wing of the museum, a high room paneled with dark wood and overlooking the museum park. When Elena entered after a brief knock, the director hastily rose from his desk.</p>

                <p>"Ah, Ms. Winters! Come in, come in."</p>

                <p>Schumann was a corpulent man with thinning hair and a preference for expensive, tailored suits. Unlike the stereotypical absent-minded museum director, he was a sharp administrator and brilliant fundraiser -- qualities the museum desperately needed to survive in times of tight public budgets.</p>

                <p>A second man stood at the window, his back turned to her. He slowly turned around as Elena entered the room. Tall, slender, in a perfectly fitting dark gray suit that put even Schumann's wardrobe in the shade. Elena estimated him to be in his mid to late thirties. His face was sharply cut, with high cheekbones and a straight nose reminiscent of classical sculptures. His hair, jet black and slightly graying at the temples, was short and precisely cut. But it was his eyes that captured Elena's attention -- dark, penetrating, and with an intensity that involuntarily reminded her of portraits by old Renaissance masters.</p>

                <p>"Ms. Winters," Schumann began, his voice a shade too enthusiastic, "may I introduce: Marcus Castellano."</p>

                <p>The man stepped forward and extended his hand to Elena. His handshake was firm and dry, his skin cool.</p>

                <p>"It's a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Winters," he said with a voice that sounded surprisingly warm, in contrast to his cool appearance. A slight accent was audible -- Mediterranean, perhaps Italian or Spanish.</p>

                <p>"Mr. Castellano is the owner of the Castellano Private Museum," Schumann explained. "One of the most significant private art collections in Europe."</p>

                <p>Elena nodded curtly. The name Castellano was familiar to her, though only marginally. An old European family, art collectors for generations, their private museum legendary but notoriously difficult for the public to access.</p>

                <p>"Please, let's sit," Schumann invited them, pointing to the seating area in the corner of the office.</p>

                <p>Elena took a seat in one of the leather armchairs, Castellano opposite her. Schumann positioned himself on a third chair, slightly apart, as if he wanted to consciously observe the interaction between his guests.</p>

                <p>"Mr. Castellano has a fascinating offer for you," the director began.</p>

                <p>Castellano leaned forward slightly. "I have followed your work on the collection of Flemish masters, Ms. Winters. Particularly your restoration of the lost details in Van Dyck's 'Lady with an Ermine' was... remarkable."</p>

                <p>Elena raised an eyebrow in surprise. The Van Dyck restoration had been a complex project she had completed two years ago. It had attracted some attention in professional circles, but she wouldn't have expected anyone outside those circles to have taken notice.</p>

                <p>"Thank you," she replied neutrally. "It was a challenging project."</p>

                <p>"You weren't just challenging, you brought back something that was thought to be lost," Castellano said. His eyes rested steadily on her, as if searching for something in her face. "This ability to reveal hidden layers without destroying what is essential -- that is a rare gift."</p>

                <p>Elena felt slight discomfort. She wasn't used to being observed so directly, much less to being praised so explicitly. Her work spoke for itself; she didn't need verbal laurels.</p>

                <p>"What is this about, Mr. Castellano?"</p>

                <p>A fleeting smile crossed his face, as if he had expected exactly this direct reaction.</p>

                <p>"My private museum houses an extensive collection that has been in my family for generations," he began. "The building itself is a historical jewel -- an early 19th-century city palace with elements from various eras. In recent years, I have had it comprehensively renovated, but..." He paused briefly. "There are areas that require special expertise."</p>

                <p>"What kind of areas?" Elena asked.</p>

                <p>"Among other things, a fresco cycle from the late 18th century located in the main hall. It is in a worrying condition -- partially overpainted, partially damaged by previous improper restoration attempts."</p>

                <p>Elena nodded slowly. Frescoes were a particular challenge -- the connection of pigment and plaster made them more susceptible to environmental influences than canvas paintings.</p>

                <p>"Furthermore," Castellano continued, "there is a collection of paintings and sculptures that also need attention. Some have never been properly restored, others have been treated by... less talented hands than yours."</p>

                <p>Schumann cleared his throat. "Mr. Castellano would like to engage you for an exclusive project, Elena. Three months at the Castellano Museum."</p>

                <p>Elena frowned. "Three months? That's a long time to be away from here."</p>

                <p>"The museum would grant you paid special leave," Schumann explained hastily. "Mr. Castellano has made an extremely generous offer to the institution in exchange for your services."</p>

                <p>She understood immediately. The museum needed money, and Castellano was willing to pay a lot. Schumann expected her to agree -- not as a request, but as a barely veiled instruction.</p>

                <p>"I already have several projects in progress," she objected. "The Diana, the Titian cycle, preparation for the autumn exhibition..."</p>

                <p>"All of that can wait or be taken over by your colleagues," Schumann interrupted her with a false smile. "We shouldn't pass up this opportunity."</p>

                <p>Elena knew when a battle was lost. The director had already decided.</p>

                <p>She turned back to Castellano. "Where exactly is your museum located, Mr. Castellano?"</p>

                <p>"On the northern Italian coast, about an hour from Genoa," he replied. "A quiet location, ideal for concentrated work. You would live in the museum itself -- there is a guest wing with comfortable apartments for specialists like you."</p>

                <p>Living in the museum. Elena suppressed a frown. She valued the separation between her work and her private space. The idea of being surrounded by foreign artworks twenty-four hours a day was both tempting and disturbing.</p>

                <p>"Why me?" she asked unexpectedly. "There are many qualified restorers, including those with more experience dealing with frescoes."</p>

                <p>Castellano regarded her with a look that was both penetrating and inscrutable. "As I said, Ms. Winters -- your ability to reveal the hidden without destroying it is rare. My collection... it requires a special approach."</p>

                <p>Something in his tone made Elena prick up her ears. There was more than just professional interest. A personal note, almost an urgency, that shimmered through behind his controlled facade.</p>

                <p>"I understand that you need time to think," Castellano continued, pulling a slim leather folder from his briefcase. "Here are the details of the project, information about the museum and your accommodation. As well as the financial conditions."</p>

                <p>He handed her the folder. Elena accepted it and opened it briefly. Her gaze fell on the number at the end of the contract draft -- a fee that almost took her breath away. It was more than she earned in an entire year at the museum.</p>

                <p>"That's very generous," she said, trying to hide her surprise.</p>

                <p>"Art has its price, Ms. Winters. Expertise as well." Castellano stood up. "I'm staying in Berlin for two more days. I hope to hear from you by then."</p>

                <p>Schumann also jumped up, eager as a schoolboy. "Of course she'll agree, won't you, Elena? Such a chance..."</p>

                <p>Elena stood up more slowly, her thoughts already on the logistical challenges that a three-month stay abroad would bring. Her apartment, her commitments here, the ongoing projects...</p>

                <p>"I'll look at it and let you know as soon as possible," she said finally.</p>

                <p>Castellano nodded as if he had expected nothing else. "Excellent. Director Schumann has my contact details." He shook her hand once more. "I look forward to our collaboration, Ms. Winters."</p>
